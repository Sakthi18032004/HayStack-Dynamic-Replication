# Facebook Haystack Implementation

## Specs
URL: `http://<Cache>/<Machine id>/<Logical volume, Photo>`

**mid** is the base64 encode of machine IP. 

**Write** - from webfront to store: 

URL: `http://<machine_ip>/upload/`

Data:
```
lvid: <lvid>
pid: <pid>
file: image binary as it is 
```

## Getting Started
Be sure to install Docker 1.12.1 on the machine that runs this system

```
sh run.sh
```

After everything is up and running, you should be able to see the 'dynamic' webpage via visiting `localhost` or `0.0.0.0` on your browser.

### View Photos
If the system is running locally, you can view the photos in the main page, that is, `http://0.0.0.0`, in which you will see three random photos. Besides, you can preview individual photo via `http://0.0.0.0/photo/pid`, in which `pid` should be replaced by a number from 1 to 5.

### Upload Photos
If the system is running locally, you can upload an image via `http://0.0.0.0/upload/`.

### Stop Containers

```
make stop
```

### Re-start Containers
After setting up via `run.sh`, you can stop these containers and start them again later. However, be aware that improper launching order might crash the system, because `h_directory` container needs some time to set up. The recommended re-launching order is as below

```
docker start h_directory
sleep 5
docker start h_cache
docker start h_nginx
docker start h_webfront
```

For your convenience, you can just

```
make resume
```

### Remove Containers
To remove all involved containers, and to delete all dangling Docker volumes

```
make clean
```

### Run Containers Manually
If you want to initialize the containers manually, such as

```
docker run -itd --name dummy dummy_image
```
there are some tricky issues. The fact is that setting up the Cassandra server in `h_directory` could take some time. If you run `h_webfront` immediately after `h_directory`, the Node.js server in `h_webfront` could fail because it cannot connect to the Cassandra server right away. Also, you must make sure that the target keyspace, such as `photo`, exists in the Cassandra server before you launch the Node.js server.

## Prototype Performance
With Chrome Developer Tools and `response-time` package in Node.js server, we could analyze the performance of our [prototype](http://playground.hyoung.me/). At the beginning, nothing is in cache and the webpage response time is shown below
<img src="./doc/imgs/case1.png " style="width: 400px;" align="center"/>

And we could also record response time of fetching image `001` at the image server, eliminating network transmission influences, as shown below in the header `X-Response-Time`
<img src="./doc/imgs/case1_detail.png " style="width: 400px;" align="center"/>

After this request, the image `001` has been cached successfully. Now, we refresh the page and make another request for the image `001`. The webpage response time is shown below
<img src="./doc/imgs/case2.png " style="width: 400px;" align="center"/>

And the image fetching time is
<img src="./doc/imgs/case2_detail.png " style="width: 400px;" align="center"/>

From these two examples, we could observe that caching does offer some performance boosting. However, this result might be kind of deceiving. After taking more trials, we find out there is a large variance in the response time, due to some factors such as CPU utilization rate, file system cache, and so on.

## Description
### Conceptual Workflow
1. when a client visits the website, the request first hits the reverse proxy server
2. the reverse proxy server sends the request to one front-end web server
3. the web server constructs a customized webpage based on the client information (in our case, we just present three random photos)
	1. the web server prepare photo ids
	2. the web server asks the Cassandra server for photo information with corresponding photo ids
	3. the web server constructs photo URLs based on the replies from the Cassandra server
	4. the web server embeds photo URLs in the webpage
4. the web server returns the dynamically generated webpage to the client via the reverse proxy server
5. the client's browser asks the Cache server for the photos
6. the client sees the customized webpage with photos


### Components Description
All components are set up in a subset `172.20.0.0\16`. Only the reverse proxy server and the Cache server are exposed to the public.

#### Reverse Proxy Server - Nginx
Responsibilities

* server as front-end web servers gateway
* load-balance client requests among front-end web servers

#### Front-end Web Server - Node.js
Responsibilities

* dynamically generate webpage (mainly photos) based on client information
	* in the prototype, just generate a webpage with three random images links
* contact the Directory (Cassandra server) for specific photo information with photo ids
* construct photo URLs and embed them into the webpage
* return the webpage to the client

#### Haystack Directory - Cassandra
Responsibilities

* maintain photo information in database: table `photo` in keyspace `photo` with schema
		
		(pid INT PRIMARY KEY, cachr_url VARSTR, mid SET<INT>, lvid INT)
* maintain logical volume mapping in database: table `store` in keyspace `photo` with schema

		(livd INT PRIMARY KEY, mid SET<INT>, status INT)
	Here, `status` field has two possible values, 0 for readably-only and 1 for writable.

#### Haystack Cache - Redis & Node.js
Responsibilities

* write-through cache 

#### Haystack Store - Docker Data Volume
Responsibilities

* Haystack file storage
* provide quick photo read based on photo id
